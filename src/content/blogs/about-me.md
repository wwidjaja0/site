Hi, my name is William Widjaja :)

I’m currently a UCSD student studying Computer Science, fueled by curiosity, a love for people, and, of course, never enough rice. 🍚

## a little about me

I was born in 2005 and identify as Indonesian-American 🇮🇩 🇺🇸. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and problem-solving, which naturally led me into computer science.

When I’m not buried in coursework, you can usually find me learning something new, cooking up a meal, or exploring places with friends.

## professional life

In the past, I had the chance to work as an intern for Saciva, a startup I joined through the Break Through Tech AI program at UCLA. Before stepping into tech, I spent almost two years at Chick-fil-A, which taught me a lot about teamwork, communication, and dealing with fast-paced environments.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep finding opportunities that challenge me and allow me to grow both technically and professionally.

Right now, I’m involved in a few roles that keep me busy and connected with different communities on campus:

- 🎟️ Student Representative at the UCSD Triton Box Office
- 💻 Event Director for UCSD ACM
- ♠️ Vice President of Poker Tritons

## hobbies & interests

Outside of school and work, I try to keep life balanced and fun. Some of my main hobbies include:

- Cooking (I love experimenting in the kitchen 🍳)
- Learning new languages
- Playing racket sports
- Exploring new places
- Hanging out with friends
- Watching Anime and K-Dramas 🎬
- Working on personal coding projects
- Playing video games (favorites: Minecraft, Skyrim, Undertale, Tetris)

## future goals

- Land a job in big tech
- Travel Europe and Asia 🌍
- Keep making spaces for community, collaboration, and fun
- Explore entrepreneurship
