## This is a sample title

Hello, this is an example Markdown file for homework 4. It demonstrates how to create a blog post using Astro's content collections.
This file is located at `src/content/blog/example-md.md` and is part of the blog collection.
You can use Markdown syntax to format your content, such as **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://example.com).
You can also include code blocks like this:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, Astro!');
```
