So I have a few qualms about this assignment...

## The issue

Don't get me wrong, this assignment and getting to use this framework was fun...

But I have a few issues, namely:

- I felt we were not given ample time for this assignment given the sparse content covered in the course in summer session 1.
- I wish there had been more opportunities for hands-on practice with the framework before diving into the assignment.

## Maybe it's just me

Okay, maybe it's just me and we have no choice because the course is really short. I get it. However, I feel like I could have had a lot more fun (than I already did) if we had more time to work on this assignment. Frameworks are fascinating and I would have loved to learn more about it, but I feel like we were rushed through the material. I would have loved to learn more about the framework and how to use it effectively, but I feel like we were just given a brief overview and then expected to figure everything out on our own.

Maybe I tried to do too much compared to what was expected? No clue. ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
